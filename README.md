## 🌌 Overview

**Entropy Mirror** is a digital organism that lives on sound.

Unlike traditional audio visualizers that just "dance" to music, this project treats sound as a physical force that distorts time and space. It listens to your environment, turning fleeting noise into a permanent visual history—a digital nebula of your day.

* **Input**: Your voice, music, or ambient room noise.
* **Output**: A unique, generative star map representing the "entropy" of that time period.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The Observer (The Core)
At the center lies a reactive neon entity. It breathes with silence and trembles with noise.
* **Quiet**: It remains a stable, flowing blue ring (Zen Mode).
* **Loud**: It fractures into a chaotic, red-gold distortion (Chaos Mode).

### 2. The Nebula Record (The History)
Every 5 seconds, the system takes a "sample" of the environment's entropy level and generates a star.
* **Quiet moments** create soft, cyan pearls.
* **Loud moments** create sharp, golden stars with a permanent nebula distortion effect behind them.

### 3. Gravitational Distortion
Loud sounds don't just change colors; they act like **black holes**. High-volume inputs trigger a gravitational shockwave, physically warping the position of every star in the background, simulating the impact of chaos on memory.

### 4. Auto-Archiving
The system acts as an ambient logger. Once the screen is filled with stars (approx. 12 minutes), it automatically saves a high-resolution snapshot of your "Sound Galaxy" and resets the canvas.
